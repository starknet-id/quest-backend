API for Starknet Quest Client project built in Rust

## About

API Starknet Quest provides the backend infrastructure for Starknet Quest Client, an app which helps protocols attract and retain users by creating gamified quests experiences on Starknet.

## Prerequisites

### Install Rust

To run the project without issues you need to have a Rust version >= 1.73.0. To check your rust version run the following command in a terminal.

```bash
rustc --version
```
If you don't have Rust installed, please go to the [Rust installation page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) for further instructions.

### Install Git

Go to the [Git installation page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the instructions for your operating system to install Git.

### Install Docker(optional)

Docker may be useful for advanced setups but is not required for basic usage since weâ€™re now leveraging MongoDB Atlas for database setup. If you wish to use Docker for other purposes, please ensure you have Docker engine version >= 1.13.0. Check your version with.

```bash
docker --version
```
If you don't have Docker installed, please go to the [Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) for further instructions.

## Installation Instructions

Fork the repository and clone the forked repository to your local system

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/api.starknet.quest.git
```

## Build Instructions

To build the project use the following command in a terminal

```bash
cargo build
```

The command above will run `cargo build` with the `--debug` flag, which compiles faster, includes debug symbols for easier debugging. However it produces a larger binary, for development purposes the command above is fine.

If you wish to create an optimized binary without debug information run the following command in a terminal

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Running the Project

To run the project successfully you'll need to do the following steps:
1. Set Up a MongoDB Atlas Database:

  - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) and create a free account if you don't have one.

  - Create a new cluster by following the instructions provided on the Atlas dashboard.

  - Once your cluster is ready, click on "Connect," then choose "Connect your application."

  - Copy the connection string provided, which should look something like this:
    [Example:]
     ( mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority )
  - Make sure your IP address is whitelisted in the Atlas security settings.

2. Create `config.toml` file using the `config.template.toml` file.
Create a `config.toml` file by copying and modifying the `config.template.toml` file. Make sure you update the following fields as required to run the project successfully:

- `connection_string`, this is the string to connect to the database.Replace with the MongoDB Atlas connection string here.
- `secret_key`, this is the secret used for the JWT token. You can change it or leave as is.
- `expiry_duration`, this is the expiry duration of the JWT token. You should change it according to your needs the time is stored in miliseconds.
- `rpc_url`, this is to interact with the blockchain you can use a public RPC such as [Lava](https://www.lavanet.xyz/get-started/starknet) or a private node provider such as [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io). Alchemy and Infura require an account to get a private RPC, while Lava is completely public.
- In the section of `[watchtower]`, set `enabled` to false. If you wish to setup the watchtower correctly, you can check the Watchtower repositories for further information. [Watchtower frontend](https://github.com/starknet-id/watchtower.starknet.id) and [Watchtower backend](https://github.com/starknet-id/watchtower_server) 

3. Run the project. 
Once the `config.toml` file is created properly, you're going to be able to run the project using the following command

```bash
cargo run
```
If you've setup everything correctly, you should see the following output

```bash
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 59.57s
     Running `target/debug/quest_server`
quest_server: starting v0.1.0
database: connected
server: listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```
If you have a different output, refer the to the Troubleshooting guide below.

If you wish to test admin endpoints, you need to add the admin manually to the database.

## Troubleshooting

If your expected output doesn't includes the following text:
```bash
database: connected
server: listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```
This means you didn't add MongoDB database. To fix this, you'll need to follow first step of the section Running the Project.

If you get the following output:

```bash
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 59.57s
     Running `target/debug/quest_server`
quest_server: starting v0.1.0
thread 'main' panicked at src/config.rs:212:9:
error: unable to read file with path "config.toml"
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

This means you didn't create the `config.toml` file. To fix this, you'll need to create the `config.toml` file with the steps mentioned in the second step of the section Running the Project.

If you get the following output:

```bash
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.55s
     Running `target/debug/quest_server`
quest_server: starting v0.1.0
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:34:49:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: RelativeUrlWithoutBase
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

This means you didn't add the `rpc_url` in the `config.toml` file. To fix this, you'll need to add the `rpc_url` to the `config.toml` file. Please refer the second step of the section Running the Project for further instructions on how to add the `rpc_url`.

If you get the following output:

```bash
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.49s
     Running `target/debug/quest_server`
quest_server: starting v0.1.0
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:29:10:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error { kind: InvalidArgument { message: "connection string contains no scheme" }, labels: {}, wire_version: None, source: None }
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

This means you didn't add the `connection_string` in the `config.toml` file. To fix this, you'll need to add the `connection_string` to the `config.toml` file. Please refer to the second step of the section Running the Project for further instructions on how to add the `connection_string`.

If you get the following output:

```bash
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 5.41s
     Running `target\debug\quest_server.exe`
quest_server: starting v0.1.0
thread 'main' panicked at src\config.rs:218:13:
error: unable to deserialize config. newline in string found at line 6 column 63
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
error: process didn't exit successfully: `target\debug\quest_server.exe` (exit code: 101)
```

This means you probably forgot the following character in the `config.toml` file: ". To fix this, you'll need to check that the fields you modified while creating the `config.toml` file have their opening and closing character. As an example, it should look like this:

`connection_string = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"`

and NOT like this

`connection_string = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

If you get the following output:

```bash
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.53s
     Running `target/debug/quest_server`
INFO: quest_server: starting v0.1.0
Failed to post log: "Invalid token or token expired"
```

This means that you didn't setup the credentials for Watchtower. To fix this, you'll need to set the `enabled` field in `[watchtower]` to false in the `config.toml` file. Please refer the second step of the section Running the Project for further instructions if you wish to keep the `[watchtower]` enabled.
